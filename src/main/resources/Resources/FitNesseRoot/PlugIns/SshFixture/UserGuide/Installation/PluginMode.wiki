!1 !-Plugin Mode Installation-!
As shown in [[!-QuickStart-!][<UserGuide]] session, the plugin mode installation can be executed just placing the fitnesse-ssh-fixture.jar in the FitNesse plugin directory or by making the jar file available in the FitNesse web server classpath. When the archive is available in classpath, documentation files and dependency libraries are automatically extracted and tuned.

!2 Documentation
Documentation files are automatically extracted in the [[!-FitNesse PlugIns-!][<PlugIns]] directory.

!2 Dependencies
To run tests with default implementations, !-SshFixture-! needs the [[jsch][http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/]] library that, in plugin mode, is also auto-extracted. To run test with customized implementations, go to [[this][<UserGuide.Customization]] page.

!2 Classpath
During plugin mode initialization, paths to required jars are stored in FitNesse context with the following keys:
 1 jsch.jar.path
 1 sshFixture.jar.path

!2 Create Test
To create a test using !-SshFixture-!, you just need to paste following lines in test/suite page:
{{{!-!path ${jsch.jar.path}
!path ${sshFixture.jar.path}-!}}}
More details on test creation available [[here][<UserGuide.SshTestCreation]].
