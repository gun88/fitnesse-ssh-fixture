Sftp commands are: download and upload; available in script mode only. In the following example, a file will be created in !-FitNesseRoot-!, uploaded via sftp on server and checked. Once uploaded and verified, the file will be modified on server and downloaded to !-FitNesseRoot-! to be finally checked.

Note: this test could fail if FitNesse user has not permissions to write files in !-FitNesseRoot-! directory.
