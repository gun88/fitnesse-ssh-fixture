!2 Create your first test
To create your first test, retrieve your ssh server endpoint and credential, then copy the following table and replace foo/bar@ssh-fitnesse.dev with: !-[username]/[password]@[hostname]:[port]-!. If your connection port is 22 (the default one) you can omit it.

|import                               |
|com.github.gun88.fitnesse.fixture.ssh|

|ssh client                       |foo/bar@ssh-fitnesse.dev |
|command                          |output?|error? |exitCode?|
|echo foo-bar                     |foo-bar|       |0        |
|echo foo-bar 1>&2                |       |foo-bar|0        |
|exit 123                         |       |       |123      |
|echo foo; echo bar 1>&2; exit 234|foo    |bar    |234      |

Note: if !-SshFixture-! is not installed as a plugin, remember to set or replace properties: jsch.jar.path, sshFixture.jar.path; with actual paths.

Note: In this example the connection was built via username and password, that are set in plain text in table header. Click [[here][<UserGuide.EndpointDefinition]] to view different authentication and credential storing methods.
