!1 !-Manual Mode Installation-!
If you do not want to use !-SshFixture-! as a plugin or extracting files, all you need to do to execute tests is set paths to fitnesse-ssh-fixture.jar and its dependencies in test pages.

{{{!path /path/tp/fitnesse-ssh-fixture.jar
!path /path/to/jsch.jar}}}

!2 Documentation
Not available out of the box in manual mode

!2 Classpath
Must be defined manually.

!2 Create Test
With this installation method, to create your test using !-SshFixture-!, you need to define paths to required jars in your test/suite page :
{{{!-!path /actual/path/to/jsch.jar
!path /actual/path/to/sshFixture.jar-!}}}
Note: differently from plugin mode, paths must be defined due to the fact that those are not stored in FitNesse context.
More details on test creation available [[here][<UserGuide.SshTestCreation]].
