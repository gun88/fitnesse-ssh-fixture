!1 !-SshFixture-! endpoint definition via VM options
!-SshFixture-! default endpoint can be also defined via VM options. This endpoint is called 'default' because, once defined, is available in all !-SshFixture-! and, as described in PasswordAuthentication page, this endpoint can be overridden and restored once called 'reset endpoint'.

The VM endpoint key is: '''ssh.fixture.endpoint''' and can be defined in code:

{{{System.setProperty("ssh.fixture.endpoint","foo/bar@ssh-fitnesse.dev");}}}

or as parameter in FitNesse launch command:

{{{java -Dssh.fixture.endpoint="foo/bar@ssh-fitnesse.dev" ...}}}

Note: priority for defined endpoints is the same used by FitNesse: wiki > VM options > file; so if endpoint is defined in property file and VM options, the one from VM options will be evaluated.
