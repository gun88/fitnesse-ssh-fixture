!1 !-SshFixture-! ignore carriage return
The default behaviour for !-SshFixture-! is to manage carriage returns like terminals. If this option is enabled, carriage return will be processed as normal text char. This option is a flag, so it just needs to be set (or unset) to works. Ignore carriage return is a single value option so, each new definition will overwrite the previous one.

Note: like every other option, can be defined in multiple ways, as shown in [[!-DefineOptions-!][<UserGuide.Options.DefineOptions]] page.
