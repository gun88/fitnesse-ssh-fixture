!1 !-SshFixture-! connection timeout
Maximum milliseconds amount to establish a connection with server. Default value is: no timeout. Connection timeout is a single value option so, each new definition will overwrite the previous one.

Note: like every other option, can be defined in multiple ways, as shown in [[!-DefineOptions-!][<UserGuide.Options.DefineOptions]] page.

Note: if !-SshFixture-! is not installed as a plugin, remember to set or replace properties: jsch.jar.path, sshFixture.jar.path; with actual paths.

Note: In this example the connection was built via username and password, that are set in plain text in table header. Click [[here][<UserGuide.EndpointDefinition]] to view different authentication and credential storing methods.
