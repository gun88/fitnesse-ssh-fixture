!1 !-SshFixture-! endpoint definition in property file
!-SshFixture-! default endpoint can be also defined in property file. This endpoint is called 'default' because, once defined, is available in all !-SshFixture-! and, as described in PasswordAuthentication page, this endpoint can be overridden and restored once called 'reset endpoint'.

The property file key is: '''ssh.fixture.endpoint''':

{{{ssh.fixture.endpoint=foo/bar@ssh-fitnesse.dev}}}

Note: the property file default name is plugins.properties (placed in the FitNesse working directory). As documented [[here][<FitNesse.UserGuide.AdministeringFitNesse.CommandLineArguments]], property file name and path can be customized.

Note: priority for defined endpoint is the same used by FitNesse: wiki > VM options > file; so if endpoint is defined in property file and VM options, the one from VM options will be evaluated.
