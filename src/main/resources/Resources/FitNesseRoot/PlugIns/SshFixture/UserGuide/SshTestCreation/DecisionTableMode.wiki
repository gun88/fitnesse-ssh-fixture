!2 Decision Table Mode
Decision table mode is the simplest way to create test for !-SshFixture-! in fact, the main example, is the same described in CreateYourFirstTest page. In this page, more details are described to explain what happen under the hood.

|import                               |
|com.github.gun88.fitnesse.fixture.ssh|

The endpoint string (foo/bar@ssh-fitnesse.dev) must be defined in table header (if not defined via [[VM options][<UserGuide.EndpointDefinition.VmOptions]] or [[properties file][<UserGuide.EndpointDefinition.PropertiesFile]]).

On table begin, a connection to the defined endpoint will be opened and closed on table end.
The decision table take as input a command string. Its available outputs are:
 1 standard output stream
 1 standard error stream
 1 execution exit code

Note: if !-SshFixture-! is not installed as a plugin, remember to set or replace properties: jsch.jar.path, sshFixture.jar.path; with actual paths.

Note: In this example the connection was built via username and password, that are set in plain text in table header. Click [[here][<UserGuide.EndpointDefinition]] to view different authentication and credential storing methods.
