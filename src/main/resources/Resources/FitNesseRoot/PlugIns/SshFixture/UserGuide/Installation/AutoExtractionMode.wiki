!1 !-Auto Extraction Mode Installation-!
If you do not want to use !-SshFixture-! as a plugin, the auto extraction utility can be executed running the following command (replaceing /path/tp/fitnesse-ssh-fixture.jar with the actual fitnesse-ssh-fixture.jar and !-/FitNesseRoot/path-! with actual !-FitNesseRoot-! path):

{{{java -classpath /path/tp/fitnesse-ssh-fixture.jar com.github.gun88.fitnesse.plugin.ssh.SshClientPlugin /FitNesseRoot/path}}}

!2 Documentation
Documentation files are extracted in the [[!-FitNesse PlugIns-!][<PlugIns.]] directory.

!2 Dependencies
To run tests with default implementations, !-SshFixture-! needs the [[jsch][http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/]] library that, in auto extraction mode, is also auto-extracted. To run test with customized implementations, go to [[this][<UserGuide.Customization]] page.

!2 Classpath
During extraction, paths to required jars are replaced in the !-SshFixture.wiki-! so the user guide file can be executed correctly. To run :
 1 jsch.jar.path
 1 sshFixture.jar.path

!2 Create Test
If auto extraction mode was used as installation method, to create your test using !-SshFixture-!, you need to define paths to required jars in your test/suite page :
{{{!-!path /actual/path/to/jsch.jar
!path /actual/path/to/sshFixture.jar-!}}}
Note: differently from plugin mode, paths must be defined due to the fact that these are not stored in FitNesse context.
More details on test creation available [[here][<UserGuide.TestCreation]].
