!1 !-SshFixture-! known hosts
This option is used to define the known-hosts file path or content. If option content does not match a file path, is evaluated as a file content. In default implementation (jsch session) if not set, server connection is not verified against this file. In test implementation (dummy session) this option is ignored. Other behaviours can be implemented with [[!-CustomSession-!][<UserGuide.Customization.CustomSession]]. Known hosts is a single value option so, each new definition will overwrite the previous one.

Note: like every other option, can be defined in multiple ways, as shown in [[!-DefineOptions-!][<UserGuide.Options.DefineOptions]] page.

Note: if !-SshFixture-! is not installed as a plugin, remember to set or replace properties: jsch.jar.path, sshFixture.jar.path; with actual paths.

Note: In this example the connection was built via username and password, that are set in plain text in table header. Click [[here][<UserGuide.EndpointDefinition]] to view different authentication and credential storing methods.
