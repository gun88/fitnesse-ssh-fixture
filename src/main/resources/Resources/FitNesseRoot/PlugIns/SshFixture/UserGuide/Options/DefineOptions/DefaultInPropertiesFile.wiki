!1 !-SshFixture-! option definition in property file
!-SshFixture-! default options can be also defined in property file. This options are called 'default' because, once defined, are available in all !-SshFixture-! and, as described in ScriptTable page, these options can be overrided and restored once called 'reset option'.

The property file key is: '''ssh.fixture.options''':

{{{ssh.fixture.options=MY_OPTION_1 MY_OPTION_2=my-value MY_OPTION_3="my value"}}}

Note: the property file default name is plugins.properties (placed in the FitNesse working directory). As documented [[here][<FitNesse.UserGuide.AdministeringFitNesse.CommandLineArguments]], property file name and path can be customized.

Note: priority for defined options is the same used by FitNesse: wiki > VM options > file; so if same options are defined in property file and VM options, the one from VM options will be evaluated.
